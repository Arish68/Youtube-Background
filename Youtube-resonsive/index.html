    <div class="hi">This is fully responsive & mobile friendly YouTube video background scaled with 16/9 aspect ratio. Actually bunch of videos - js loads 1 of 7 with different start/end times, then it loops.<br><br>BTW It is mobile friendly unless you use autoplay feature (as in this example) - for mobile it needs to be disabled. We'll fix it in couple of days & this pen is going to detect whether or not it's ok to autoplay. Also, the video isn't centered because of how CodePen works (iframe).<br><br>Click <span>here</span> to <i>unmute</i> the vid. Enjoy!</div>
